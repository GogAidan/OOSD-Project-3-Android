# OOSD-Project-3-Android
The 2nd half of our final project, an android app that is customer oriented.

This android app was designed to be an easy and pleasant to use customer based app. It allows customers to utilize a login feature that would enable them to be able to book a travel package, edit their personal information, and view their previously booked packages.
